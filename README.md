  asynchronously.
- [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) - A flow is an asynchronous
  version of a Sequence, a type of collection whose values are lazily produced.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) -
  Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [Stateflow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) - StateFlow is a
    state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors.
  - [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) - A flow is an asynchronous
    version of a Sequence, a type of collection whose values are lazily produced.

## Back-end üõ∞Ô∏è
The app uses retrofit to retrieve data from [News API](https://newsapi.org/). For more information, read the [documentation](https://newsapi.org/docs). You would need to log in to get an API key. Paste the API key in ``` app/src/main/java/com/example/newzap/util/Constants.kt ```

## Architecture üóº

This app uses [***MVVM (Model View
View-Model)***](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture.

## Build-tool üß∞
